# Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to help Dana create a dynamic webpage to help display the data with a table, add filters in an html.  For table would help provide  more information to  about the different sighting locations.  Having the ability to filter would help people narrow down their own search of what they are looking for based on date, city, state, country and shape.

Below is the final webpage, with filtered table examples already provided for users.

# Results: 
If someone was looking for something specific on for an UFO sighting, they would just need to enter the inforamtion in the filter table on the left side.  They would first have to enter the date information so they can see what options they have next.  Then, they can continue to drill down and enter the information in the filter table.  

For example, I entered the date, "1/10/2010", city "roswell", state "ca", country "us", shape "circle" and below is the information that returned.
