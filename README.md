# Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to help Dana create a dynamic webpage to help display the data with a table, add filters in an html.  For table would help provide  more information to  about the different sighting locations.  Having the ability to filter would help people narrow down their own search of what they are looking for based on date, city, state, country and shape.

Below is the final webpage, with filtered table examples already provided for users.

# Results: 
If someone was looking for something specific on for an UFO sighting, they would just need to enter the inforamtion in the filter table on the left side.  They would first have to enter the date information so they can see what options they have next.  Then, they can continue to drill down and enter the information in the filter table.  

For example, I entered the date, "1/10/2010", city "roswell", state "ca", country "us", shape "circle" and below is the information that returned.

# Summary: 
Overall, all the information is listed on the webpage as expected.  However, a few drawbacks to this design is the overall user-experience. A user must know what they are looking for which limits some users who may not know the all the information.  The filters stops at shape and doesn't allow a user to filter by duration which may be important if they were looking to see any correlation of between different states or shapes. 

My recommendation for further development:  
  * Add more filters to the table so users can filter what they are looking for.  This would assist them even more if they were looking to create an analysis.
    * More filters would include: duration filter and separating out the datetime for months and years 
  * Add a drop mean so customers can see all the selection available to them to choose
  * Add a clear all button so users don't have to refresh the page everytime they want to use restart their search
